# What is the aim?

- True love uwu.
- More realistically though, some booty.
- Even more realistically, just optimising emotional investment.

We'll use selenium to interact with the tinder web app, and then train a machine learning model on your attraction preferences to (hopefully accurately) decide on which way to swipe.

# Live Demo

Ooh, ambitious.
